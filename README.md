# Put Hermit Lite App APKs in your App Drawer - Easy Creator

This project is a fork of [github.com/chimbori/hermit-lite-app-example](https://github.com/chimbori/hermit-lite-app-example) that is easy to use through the use of Github Workflows. You can even do this from your phone!
Hermit Lite Apps can be placed in your App Drawer in addition to on your home screen.

Since this feature involves creating a separate APK, it cannot be included in the main app.

Create your own APKs by copying this repository and customizing just a few items.
- Lite App URL
- Lite App Name
- Android App Package Name
- Logo
